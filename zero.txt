4.2.1.2. JanusGraph Embedded
JanusGraphFactory can also be used to open an embedded JanusGraph graph instance from within 
a JVM-based user application. In that case, JanusGraph is part of the user 
application and the application can call upon JanusGraph directly through its public API.


///////////////////
4.2.1.3. Short Codes
If the JanusGraph graph cluster has been previously configured and/or only the storage backend 
needs to be defined, JanusGraphFactory accepts a colon-separated string representation of 
the storage backend name and hostname or directory.

graph = JanusGraphFactory.open('cassandra:localhost')
